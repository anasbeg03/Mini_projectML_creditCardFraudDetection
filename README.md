# Credit Card Fraud Detection - Mini Project (ML)

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It is part of a portfolio to demonstrate data science skills as a fresher in 2025.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Fraudulent transactions are rare but highly impactful. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify fraudulent vs. genuine transactions based on given features.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Size**: 284,807 transactions
- **Note**: Due to class imbalance (fraud = 0.17%), special techniques like under/oversampling may be used.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 ML Techniques

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Scaling
- Class Imbalance Handling (SMOTE, undersampling)
- Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model Evaluation (Precision, Recall, AUC-ROC)

## ✅ Results

- Best model: Random Forest with precision 92%, recall 89%
- AUC Score: 0.98
- Balanced performance between fraud detection and false positives

## 📊 Visualizations

Key plots included:
- Class distribution
- Correlation matrix
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curves
